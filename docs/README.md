# ABOUT

vmWalkingKit is an animation tool for Maya developed with Python for my Bachelor's Thesis. The tool's goal is to teach the theory behind walking animations while giving the user an interactive playground to experiment while learning. This will be achieved by providing an easy-to-use UI that will allow the animator to tweak parameters in order to modify the end result of a character walking animation. The parameters will be divided into sections representing the main parts of the body.

The program will also come with a set of tool tips and useful information regarding walking animations and the available parameters. This tool is heavily based on the theory of *The Animator's Survival Kit* by Richard Williams; as it contains one of the best studies on the subject of walking.
